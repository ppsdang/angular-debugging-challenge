# Angular Debugging Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the Angular Debugging Challenge! This repository contains a basic Angular application representing a simple to-do list. The application has a few intentional bugs that you are required to identify and fix. The exercise tests your understanding of Angular fundamentals, including components, services, data binding, and debugging skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- Angular CLI (https://angular.io/cli)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone [URL of the repository]
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd angular-debugging-challenge
3. Install the necessary packages:
   npm install

### Running the Application
1. Start the Angular application:
   ng serve
2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

## Your Task
Your task is to debug and fix the issues in the application. The application is intended to allow users to add tasks to a to-do list and display them. Specifically, you need to:

1. Ensure that the form input properly binds to the component property.
2. Correctly update the list of tasks when a new task is added.
3. Prevent empty or whitespace-only task entries.

## Tips
- Carefully read through the code in each file. The issues could be in any of the following files:
- `app.module.ts`
- `app.component.ts` and `app.component.html`
- `todo/todo.component.ts`, `todo/todo.component.html`, and `todo/todo.component.css`
- `todo.service.ts`
- Pay attention to Angular concepts like modules, components, services, data binding, and form handling.
- Use browser developer tools and Angular CLI tools to help identify and fix issues.
